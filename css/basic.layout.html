<p>Januar 2025s full moon is the highest hanging moon of this year
    in the orthern 
    hemisphere. That is because the moon mirrors the suns path across the sky, and 
    full moon is, by defination, opposite the sun. Since the sun at its lowest in the sky during the winter solistice in the 
    late december, the full moon that occurs closest to it must be the highest.
    The wolf moon will also be the nihgt sky for longer than any othe moon of 
    the year.</p>
